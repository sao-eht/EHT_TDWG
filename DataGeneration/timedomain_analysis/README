-- USAGE NOTE FOR THE TOOLS --
(Hotaka Shiokawa, 8/29/2017, hshiokawa@cfa.harvard.edu )


This directory contains tools that generate time vs. closure quantities
with a thermal noise and the earth rotation effect taken into account,
for all triangles and quadrangles that have data during a specified
time range of an observation.  It is using eht-imaging package
(https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging) written in Python3 developed by
Andrew Chael.  The tools also have Lomb-Scargle analyser ready to work
on the generated data with a preliminary significance calculator.


The best way to get familiar with the tools is understanding the
example code, "example.py", which we walk through line by line in this
documentation.  After setting up your environment,

>> python example.py

will produce 3 plots in 2 windows.
1st window:
Closure phase [deg] vs Time [UT hr] for a specific triangle (ALMA-LMT-SMTO by default)
Closure amplitude vs Time [UT hr] for a specific quadrangle (ALMA-LMT-SMAP-SPT by default)
2nd window:
Lomb-Scargle Periodogram for the closure phase plot in the 1st window
with significance.


There are few preparations needed to run example.py.  First, you need to
add the reference to ehtim package (almost identical to the original but
slightly modified for these new tools), which is defined in DataGeneration
directory, to PYTHONPATH, e.g.:

export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:'path to whereever you cloned EHT_TDWG'/EHT_TDWG/DataGeneration


Secondly, you need to download movies to perform the
synthetic observations on.  Please contact Hotaka Shiokawa
(hshiokawa@cfa.harvard.edu) to obtain the links to the data files.
Currently available ones are:
1) Hot spot model introduced in Doeleman et al. (2009), model B (HotSpot)
2) The above hot spot model merged with ray-traced movie of GRMHD
disk simulation, disk model for a=0.94 in Roelofs et al. (2017) (HotSpot_Disk)
3) The above hot spot model merged with ray-traced movie of GRMHD
disk simulation, jet model for a=0.94 in Roelofs et al. (2017) (HotSpot_Jet)

As a sub-step, you would need to install several python packages, such
as astropy and gatspy if you do not have them yet.



== example.py, line by line ==

- Modules - 
In addition to the ehtim modules, "closure" and "LS" need to be imported
that are defined in this directory in closure.py and LS.py, respectively.
closure.py manages operations regarding time series of closure quantities,
and LS.py manages operations regarding Lomb-Scargle periodogram.
The latter is independent from the rest of package/code.


- Decide observational schedule --

vex = ve.Vex("vex_files/EHT2017/night3.vex")

The above line imports the real observational schedule used for the 3rd
night of the EHT2017 observation.  The schedule, as well as various
information regarding the observation, are written in "vex" format.
Other EHT2017 vex files are available in the directory "vex_files",
or more variations can be found on EHT wiki.


- Decide number of frames to read-in, "nframes" -

We first need to know duration of each frame in the movies, so that
we can calculate how many frames are needed to be read-in for the given
observational schedule.  All the models we currently have are based on the
hotspot model of which the frame duration is 16.2sec. Orbital period of
the hotspot is 27min, i.e.  the pure hot spot movie is repetitive every
100 frames.  You can adjust the orbital period by tuning this variable,
although too much speeding up/down makes those hotspot+GRMHD movies less
physical as they are adjusted for SgrA* mass. The longer framedur_sec,
the smaller thermal noise of the closure quantities will be.

mjd_s, mjd_e = vex.get_obs_timerange('SGRA')

This function gives you time range that a very first and last moments
that any available station observe the source in modified Julian date.
Number of frames "nframes" then is calculated by taking difference of
them and divide by the frame duration.

nframes = int(np.round(duration_hr/(framedur_sec/3600.)))


- Load a movie -

ehtim.movie.load_movie_* is used to read-in the movie frames to be
synthetically observed, where * depends on format of the movie files.

mov = lo.load_movie_txt("HotSpot_Disk/", nframes, framedur=framedur_sec)

It returns a Movie object defined in ../ehtim/movie.py.  The standard
format is self-explanatory and straight forward to understand once you
see the actual file (which is in ASCII).  HotSpot_Disk and HotSpot_Jet
are in this format and read-in by "load_movie_txt".  The original hot
spot movie HotSpot is in fits format and only 100 frames are available
that need to be used repeatedly since usual observation duration is much
longer. For that reason the special "load_movie_fits_hotspot" is used.
Choose a desired movie by commenting/uncommenting the lines, or create
your own movie by following the standard format.


- Observe the movie -

The Movie object obtained in the previous step ("mov" in the example code)
can be observed as

obs = mov.observe_vex( vex, 'SGRA', t_int=framedur_sec )

using the observation schedule in the vex file.  It returns Obsdata object
defined in ../ehtim/obsdata.py.  The observation includes thermal noise
but not scattering by default.  Pass sgrscat=True if you want to include
scattering effects.  Another option is "mov.observe()" which is for a
continuous observation.  Example usage of mov.observe() will be added.


- Get closure quantities' time series -

The Obsdata object ("obs" in the example code) obtained in the previous
step contains information of time series of closure quantities.  We can
conveniently manage it by obtaining Closure object as

clo = cl.Closure(obs)

defined in closure.py.  Now you can access the time series of closure
phase as

clo.cp[triangle ID]

where "triangle ID" is ID of a triangle that you want to obtain data.
Stations that consist the triangle is stored in

clo.tri[triangle ID].

In the example code, triangle ID is set to 12, where

clo.tri[12] = ('ALMA', 'LMT', 'SMTO').'

clo.tri contains all possible triangles that have data in the observation,
i.e. len(clo.tri) = Total number of triangles that have data.  Note that
it includes triangles that have stations at the same site, i.e.  SMAP and
JCMT, and ALMA and APEX.  Those triangles should have negligibly small
closure phase but only thermal noise.


clo.cp[triangle ID] consists of 3 arrays:
clo.cp[triangle ID][0] = time in UT[hr]
clo.cp[triangle ID][1] = closure phase in degrees
clo.cp[triangle ID][2] = error in degrees

Therefore, you can plot time vs. closure phase for the 12th triangle as

errorbar( clo.cp[12][0], clo.cp[12][1], yerr=clo.cp[12][2] )

You can also record this data in ASCII file by

clo.record_cp(12)

which generates a file named "cp_ALMA-LMT-SMTO" with 3 columns of time,
closure phase, and error.


For closure amplitude, just change the array names to
cp - > ca
tri -> quad
and 'triangle ID' is now 'quadrangle ID'.


- Get Lomb-Scargle periodogram - 

freq, power = LS.get_LS_periodogram(clo.cp[tri_id])

This function, defined in LS.py, takes an array of format
[[time],[value],[error]] (which is just the format of cp and ca in the
code) and returns Lomb-Scargle periodogram.  You need to install gatspy
package (http://www.astroml.org/gatspy/periodic/lomb_scargle.html) for
this operation.  LS.py uses "LombScargleMultibandFast()" by default, but
there are other options available.  Please see the description at the
gatspy link.  The returned power is normalized, equivalent to equation
13.8.4 of Numerical Recipes Third Edition.

You can use a function that calculates significance value for a given
time series.

signif_z = LS.get_significance( t, signif )

where signif=0.001 in the code, which means that the singificance of
the returned value signif_z is 0.1% in a periodogram that uses the time
series t.  In the example code, "t" is the time component of the closure
quantities' array, e.g. clo.cp[12][0] for a periodogram of 12th triangle.
One needs to be aware that the calculator works only for the case of
the null hypothesis, which is not necessarily the case in our problem.
See Section 13.8 Numerical Recipes Third Edition for more details.
